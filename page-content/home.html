	<p class="lead">I work on technologies that bring people together. My research involves building the future of telepresence, remote collaboration, and social computing. I design, prototype, and evaluate user experiences for these purposes, involving emerging technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR), telepresence robots, tangible and haptic user interfaces, drones, and video communication. I also conduct user studies and empirical research in HCI to understand user behaviours and various technologiesâ€™ impacts on factors such as group collaboration, awareness, and presence. I am both a researcher and a builder. I like to blow minds and warm hearts.</p>
