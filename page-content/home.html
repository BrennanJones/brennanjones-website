	<h1>Brennan Jones</h1>
	<p class="lead">I am a human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher who is passionate about designing and evaluating technologies for people, the future, and the greater good. Domains include: development tools for cloud gaming; technologies for emergency response (search and rescue, emergency video calling); virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) interfaces; technologies for remote and hybrid work; and technologies for connecting friends and family members.</p>
	<p class="lead">I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://hcitang.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Anthony Tang</a> (<a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>) in the <a href="https://ricelab.github.io/" target="_blank">RICELab group</a> and <a href="https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">Interactions Lab</a>. During my PhD, I also worked with <a href="http://carmann.ca/" target="_blank">Dr. Carman Neustaedter</a> as a Visiting Scholar in the <a href="http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Connections Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html" target="_blank">School of Interactive Arts and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>.</p>
	<p class="lead">I am experienced in conducting user studies and foundational research in HCI using methods such as interviews, observations, lab experiments, survey research, and ethnographic methods, to understand user behaviours and technologiesâ€™ impacts on factors such as group collaboration, awareness, and presence. I have published at top-tier HCI venues, including ACM CHI, CSCW, and DIS. I am both a researcher and a builder, with experience in full-stack development, and comfortable embracing a variety of tools to build prototypes. I have a rich range of experience in front-end web development, back-end server coding, AR/VR development, mobile app development, and robotics programming. I like to blow minds and warm hearts.</p>
