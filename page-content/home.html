	<p class="lead">I have training and skills as a computer scientist, developer, designer, researcher, and communicator. My interests are in designing, building, and studying technologies that connect people across distances for work and play. For fun, I enjoy hiking, cycling, travelling, photography, dogs, cats, occasional video gaming, making up bad puns, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
