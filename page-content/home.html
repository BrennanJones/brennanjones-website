	<p class="lead">Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, working with <a href="https://hcitang.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Anthony Tang</a> (<a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>) in the <a href="https://ricelab.github.io/" target="_blank">RICELab group</a> and in the <a href="https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">Interactions Lab</a>. I am also working with <a href="https://carmster.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Carman Neustaedter</a> in the <a href="http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Connections Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html" target="_blank">School of Interactive Arts and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>.</p>
	<p class="lead">I work on technologies that bring people together. My research involves building the future of telepresence, remote collaboration, and social computing. I design, prototype, and evaluate user experiences for these purposes, involving emerging technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR), telepresence robots, tangible and haptic user interfaces, drones, and video communication. I also conduct user studies and empirical research in HCI to understand user behaviours and various technologiesâ€™ impacts on factors such as group collaboration, awareness, and presence. I am both a researcher and a builder. I like to blow minds and warm hearts.</p>
	<p><i>Please excuse that my website is (as of November 2020) somewhat under construction. I am currently adding <a href="index.php?section=projects">project</a> pages for my more recent projects. Project pages that are currently missing will gradually appear, one-by-one, within the next few weeks or so. Please bear with me. :)</i></p>
