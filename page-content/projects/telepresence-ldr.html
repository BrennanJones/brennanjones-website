	<p>Computer mediated-communication tools (CMC) support loved ones in maintaining connections with one another over distance, yet it can be difficult to do activities together. We studied the use of telepresence robots for supporting distance-separated loved ones in engaging in the joint activity of shopping over distance. One partner shopped in person while the other used either a telepresence robot or a tablet from a remote location. Compared to the tablet group, we found that when partners communicated through a telepresence robot, the remote partner's personality and presence were expressed through the movements and physicality of the medium. However, the use of the telepresence robot introduced tension between partners regarding responsibility, dependency, and contribution to the act of shopping. These results demonstrate the benefits of a mobile embodiment for remote partners, as well as the need for greater physical capabilities to support both physical connection and remote contribution to leisure activities.</p>
