	<p>People are increasingly using mobile video conferencing (e.g., Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts) to communicate, collaborate, and share experiences while on the go. Yet this presents challenges in adequately sharing camera views with remote users. For this project, we studied the use of semi-autonomous drones for video conferencing, where an outdoor user (using a smartphone) is connected to a desktop user (e.g., who is at home or in an office) who can explore the environment from the drone's perspective. I designed and built a prototype system following this setup; and in collaboration with colleagues from both inside and outside my lab, we ran an observational study to see how users would interact through this setup. Our study showed that there are benefits of providing the desktop user with a view that is elevated, manipulable, and decoupled from the outdoor user. In addition, our participants overcame challenges in communicating environmental information and navigational cues, negotiated control of the view, and used the drone as a tool for sharing experiences. This provides a new way of thinking about mobile video conferencing, where cameras that are decoupled from both users play an integral role in communication, collaboration, and sharing experiences.</p>
